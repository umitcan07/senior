# Nonce Feature Status

## ✅ Implemented

### Frontend
- Home page with feature showcase
- Practice text list with filtering (difficulty, type, word count)
- Text detail page with reference selector
- Audio recording UI (live waveform, controls, state management)
- Analysis results page (connected to DB)
- Summary/Feed page (UI complete, using mock data)
- Admin: Text CRUD (create, read, update, delete, bulk import)
- Admin: Author management (CRUD)
- Admin: Reference speech management (CRUD, audio playback)
- Settings page (preferred author selector)
- Learn page (IPA chart with audio playback)
- Authentication (Clerk integration)
- Navigation bar with theme toggle
- Error handling UI components
- Loading states and skeletons
- Audio recording backend integration
- Real analysis results display
- Audio upload functionality
- Segment player for error timestamps with speed controls
- Enhanced DiffViewer with interactive segments
- Audio player timeline with error markers
- Animated score cards with descriptive labels

### Database
- Full schema (all tables: practice_texts, authors, reference_speeches, user_recordings, analyses, alignments, phoneme_errors, word_errors, audio_quality_metrics, user_preferences)
- Database migrations (Drizzle)
- CRUD operations for texts, authors, references
- Indexes for query optimization
- Type-safe ORM (Drizzle)
- User recording storage
- Analysis result storage

### Backend
- RunPod endpoint structure (assessment, IPA generation)
- Edit distance algorithm for phoneme comparison
- Audio loading utilities
- Server functions for text, author, reference management
- Audio API endpoints (reference playback, IPA learning audio)
- Audio file upload to R2 (Cloudflare)
- Server functions for recording and analysis retrieval

### Model/GPU
- RunPod handler structure
- Assessment endpoint skeleton
- IPA generation endpoint skeleton

## 🔨 WIP (Work In Progress)

### Frontend
- Error boundary component
- Reference speech playback integration
- Progress charts/graphs (UI exists but no data)

### Backend
- Audio quality metrics calculation (SNR, clipping, etc.)
- Real-time analysis processing pipeline

### Model/GPU
- POWSM model integration (placeholder currently)
- MFA alignment for verified timestamps
- Real pronunciation assessment (currently simulated on backend)

---

## ❌ Not Started

### Frontend
- Common errors aggregation (mock data)
- Audio quality feedback UI
- Offline mode support
- Search functionality
- Advanced filtering

### Database
- User preferences persistence (schema exists, not connected)
- Analysis history queries (partially done for recent attempts)
- Error aggregation queries
- Progress tracking queries

### Backend
- TTS generation for reference speeches (ElevenLabs integration)
- IPA generation from text/audio (calls to RunPod)
- User preferences API

### Model/GPU
- POWSM model inference (text-to-IPA)
- POWSM model inference (audio-guided IPA)
- ASR model for word recognition
- MFA forced alignment
- Real phoneme extraction from audio
- Pronunciation scoring algorithm
- Error detection and classification

## Notes

- **Analysis Results**: Now fetching real data from DB, but the data itself is generated by a mock scorer until Python service is connected.
- **Recording**: Full loop (Record -> Upload -> Save -> Mock Analyze -> View) is working.
- **Upload**: File upload is supported alongside recording.
- **ML Models**: All endpoints use placeholder/dummy implementations.
- **Audio Quality**: Schema exists, calculation not implemented.
- **TTS**: Schema supports it, generation not implemented.
